Camera Calibration Demo
======================

This is sitting here because it took me far too long to do this from the docs. 

This will process live video from the camera, and should be used with the acircles_pattern.png printout. 
run ./camera_calibration config.xml . A window appears. Hold up the circles, and they will be joined by lines. 

Press G, move the paper around. It will calibrate, and provide you with an output.xml of the camera characteristics. 

You can then use this in other programs. 

We need to calibrate the raspberry pi camera. 


Other
======

The images.xml is there in case you want to statically set up the camera from pictures. It can apparently also be calibrated from prerecorded video. 

The makefile works for opencv in homebrew on my mac. Hopefully will also work on the pi.
